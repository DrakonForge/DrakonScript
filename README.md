# Scripting Language for Contextual Dialogue

This language compiles to JSON.

To run, open the command line in this folder then run `node compile.js <filename>`.

This language works best with JavaScript syntax highlighting, but some workarounds may be needed to avoid error highlighting. One hacky solution available for VS Code is my custom **DrakonScript language extension** for `.drkn` files, which colors the syntax like JavaScript but does not highlight errors.
